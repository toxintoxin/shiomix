# Introduction

Based on `shiny`, a package of `R`. I konw `Shiny for Python` is in development, also from the company Posit, it looks like python is replacing R. At the same time they introduced the `quarto`, which seems to be a replacement for the rmarkdown. Did the R fall short? No, I think that at least R is still the gold standard for statistics in scientific research.

All the separate panels are designed as separate modules, I'm not trying to complicate the whole process, it has the advantage that it's not forced on anyone, you can just walk away after using any of the functions and continue to do things with your favorite tool, which was my original intention, and it doesn't require an account or paying for it, which I hate, I love the no-installation, out-of-the-box, read-it-now, kind of model, which is what this application is all about.

If you think it's too slow, you can also let it run locally, all you need is to install R, download my repo, install several R packages and a command in R that will allow you to run the same application locally

基于`shiny`，一个R包。我知道`Shiny for Python`正在快速发展中，也是来自于Posit公司，python似乎有想取代R的趋势。与此同时，他们推出了`quarto`，似乎是rmarkdown的替代品。R会快速消亡吗？不，我认为至少在科学研究的数据分析中，仍然是黄金标准。

所有分开的频道都是独立的模块，我并不是要把整个过程复杂化，这是有它的优势的，它不会把任何人捆绑到我的app上，你可以在用完这个app的某个功能后直接离开，用你喜欢的工具继续工作，这也是我最初的愿望，app不需要账号或者付费，这是我讨厌的，我喜欢没有安装的，开箱即用的，阅后即焚的，这种模式，这个app就是这样的。

如果你觉得网页运行太慢了，你可以让它在本地运行，你需要的仅仅是安装R，下载我的源代码库，安装一些必要的R包，然后在R中运行一个命令就能让你在本地运行相同的app。
